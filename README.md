# Ana-Bennett---Portfolio


## Description



My motivation for this assignment was to build a portfolio page with the exact criteria that we were givin using HTML and CSS.
I built the project to be able to have a portfolio to showcase my work to potential employers the link is here to the live page https://sydneychick2748.github.io/Ana-Bennett---Portfolio/
Building this assignment lets you  show case your work and have all your contact information nicely formatted and being able to be mobile and tablet lets people see your portfolio on a smaller device if they choose to.
Working on this assignment was fun and but challenging using flex-box. Flex-box is a great tool that need to be used for almost every website that i will build so i want to become stronger at flex-box and making this webpage was really good practice you can see the code here https://github.com/Sydneychick2748/Ana-Bennett---Portfolio

## Installation

I had to set up the assignment using HTML and CSS.
The project had to look similar to the image we were given that follows a specific layout and functionality.
When on the page you have to be presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me , my work and contact me. When you click one of the links in the navigation and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When you click on the link to the section  my work and the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my projects
When  presented with the my  first project and that projects image should be larger in size than the others
When you click  on the images of the project you will be  taken to that deployed application
and make it responsive for tablet and mobile.
