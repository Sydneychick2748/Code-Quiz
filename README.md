# Code-Quiz


## Description

The project is a quiz for javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers and myself by storing and displaying all the scores played in the game.
The quiz is designed to let the user take questions on javascript and be able to see the scores and compare them to others who took the quiz or if you want to play against yourself. If you would like to check out the game or play the game, you can view  it at  the live site https://sydneychick2748.github.io/Code-Quiz/
I learned that vanilla javascript is a very powerful language and is also challenging to learn. I started doing the project with multiple Javascript, CSS, and HTML files, and then trying to pass the information to one another was very difficult as I just am learning Javascript it became very confusing. There were many problems that I faced. The variables from one page would be null on the other. I decided that since I was so far in with all the HTML and CSS pages, I would leave them the way they were and make one main Javascript file. This also posed a problem because I had links to different pages for the HTML and the CSS but one big JS file. I had to continually put my code in if statements so the variables would not appear null. In retrospect, I would have made one HTML, one CSS, and one javaScript and hidden elements and presented each section accordingly. I would have liked to have an input button for the storage of the name/initials, but when I attempted to change things, my code crashed, and I contacted the tutors, and I had to make a whole new file being so close to the due date I decided to leave the prompt. This assignment stressed me, but I see how practical js is, and I would love to do more of these assignments so that I can  learn and get better at Javascript
